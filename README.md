**vnak** is like a visual [nak](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nak), but also different and less complete (for now).

it's a native desktop program made with [Qt](https://www.qt.io/).

to install, grab a binary from [releases](https://github.com/fiatjaf/vnak/releases) or build from source with `go install github.com/fiatjaf/vnak` (the first time you do this may take 20 minutes because of Qt, but on the following updates that it will be fast).
